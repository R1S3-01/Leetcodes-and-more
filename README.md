This is just my documenting some of the problems I will be solving from this point onwards, in an attempt to create a public discography of my programming.
I wont be uploading my prevsiously completed Leetcodes  and algorithms as i feel that is somewhat unncessary and there is over 150 of them... 
However, if you would like and impression of some of the other problems i have solved, feel free to check my leetcode account. Please dont judge the accuracy score on my profile, i submite the codes for testing purposes, largely expecting them to be initally wrong.
